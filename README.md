# Pathfinding

## Visualisation in Minecraft
Pathfinding is a cool concept that is best visualized on grids,
so that's why I decided to implement it in Minecraft. 

This is a Minecraft plugin using the [Paper API](https://github.com/PaperMC/Paper "PaperMC") which visualizes
different pathfinding algorithms on a 2D surface (for now).

It is my free-time project, and it's work in progress.

## How to run it
You can either try to build it on your own with Maven, or wait.
Soon, I'll make releases with pre-compiled `JARs`.

When you have the `.jar` file, just drop it in the `plugins` folder
of your paper server.
